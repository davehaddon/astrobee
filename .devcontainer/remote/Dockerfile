#   xvfb: X server that doesn't need GPU or physical display
#   x11vnc: VNC server that shares xvfb display with external VNC clients
#   xfce4: lightweight window manager
#   dbus-x11: inter-process communication needed by xfce
#   x11-apps: X11 apps to demo such as xeyes
#   x11-utils: debugging commands such as xdpyinfo
#   x11-xserver-utils: setup commands such as xset
