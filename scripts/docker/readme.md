\page install-docker Developing with Docker

# Preliminaries

Before running these instructions, make sure you visit the main Astrobee INSTALL page and:
- Check the system requirements.
- Follow the Docker-option install steps 1-2, install Docker and check out the Astrobee Robot Software (ARS).

# Option 1: Using Visual Studio Code

You may find it helpful to use VSCode's Docker integration to help you interactively develop inside a Docker container.

## Install VSCode and the Dev Containers plugin

There are many valid ways to install VSCode. These commands are for an APT-style installation on Ubuntu:

```bash
wget -q https://packages.microsoft.com/keys/microsoft.asc -O- | sudo apt-key add -
sudo add-apt-repository "deb [arch=amd64] https://packages.microsoft.com/repos/vscode stable main"
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install -y code
```

Docker integration is based on the Dev Containers plugin, which you can install with:

```bash
code --install-extension ms-vscode-remote.remote-containers
```

## Use VSCode to open the folder inside the Docker container

Tthe Dev Containers plugin will download a pre-built ARS Docker image from our official repository, start it running, and provide you with a development environment running inside the container.

Start VS Code, run the `Dev Containers: Open Folder in Container...` command from the Command Palette (F1); Or you can open the `$ASTROBEE_WS/src` folder through the VSCode graphical interface, and you should then see a popup dialog from the Dev Containers plugin. Click the "Reopen in Container" button.

You can choose between the `local` and `remote` profile. The `remote` profile is designed to run on remote servers and it is configured to open a vnc server and broadcast it in port 5900.

After the devcontainer has started, if you continue using `DISPLAY=:0` (default), it will open the graphical application on the vnc server, if you set `DISPLAY=:1` in the terminal with `export DISPLAY=:1`, it will forward using X11 (you can switch back to `:0` for vnc).
To open the vnc viewer in your local:

```bash
sudo apt-get install xtightvncviewer
vncviewer localhost::5900 -encodings "copyrect tight hextile zlib corre rre raw"
```

You can manage your Dev Containers configuration using the files in the `.devcontainer` folder at the top level. For example, you can select a different Docker image to install from [the list on GitHub](https://github.com/nasa/astrobee/pkgs/container/astrobee) using the `FROM` command in the `Dockerfile`.

## Interactively develop inside the Docker container

You can start by selecting `View->Terminal` in the VSCode graphical interface. This will display a terminal session inside the Docker container where you can run arbitrary commands. Your container will persist throughout your VSCode session, and changes you make using the VSCode editor will be reflected inside the container, making it easy to do quick interactive edit/build/test cycles.

## Enable x-forwarding from the Dev Container (local)

In a cmd line in your host environment (not in the docker container) run:
```bash
xhost local:docker
```
this needs to be done everytime you restart vscode, and enables the screen forwarding such that you can open graphical guis like rviz.

## Building + testing the code

This runs inside the Docker container:

```bash
catkin build
./scripts/run_tests.sh
```

For more information on running the simulator and moving the robot, please see the \ref running-the-sim.

(Going forward, we could add a lot of tips here about how best to use VSCode inside the container.)

# Option 2: Using the Docker support scripts

## Quick start run

You can install ARS inside a Docker container and run a software simulation with:

```bash
cd $ASTROBEE_WS/src
./scripts/docker/run.sh --remote
```

Invoking `run.sh --remote` calls Docker with the right arguments such that it will download the latest pre-built complete ARS image from our official Docker image repository, start it as a container, and invoke a default command inside the container (which runs the software simulation).

## Quick start build (if needed)

The fastest way to recompile ARS to reflect your local changes is:

```bash
./scripts/docker/build.sh --remote astrobee_quick
```

Invoking `build.sh --remote` calls Docker with the right arguments such that it will download the latest pre-built complete ARS image from our official Docker image repository. Then it will build the `astrobee_quick` target, which does a quick recompile of the ARS software to reflect your changes, accelerated by using previously cached compilation results.

# Overview of Docker support scripts

ARS provides two main support scripts for working with Docker.

The `build.sh` script builds new ARS Docker images, with many configuration options described later. As discussed in the "Quick start run" section, you can always start by running one of our pre-built images. You only need to build your own new image if you've modified the software.

The `run.sh` script (optionally downloads and) runs ARS Docker images.

The two scripts have similar options to make it easy to run the specific image you just built.

If you want to run the docker containers directly on remote servers (with no display), there are methods to do this via VNC in \subpage vnc-docker or X11 in \subpage ssh-docker

# Building Docker images

## Build stages

Among the `build.sh` command-line arguments, you can list targets you want to build. Some of the targets correspond to Docker images at different build stages:

- `astrobee_base` - Starts with a baseline Ubuntu distribution and installs the external dependencies of ARS, including a ROS distribution and many external libraries built from source.
- `astrobee` - Starts with `astrobee_base` and builds the ARS software.
- `astrobee_quick` - Starts with `astrobee` and does a quick rebuild of the ARS software.
- `test_astrobee` - Starts with `astrobee` and runs the subset of ARS tests that are compatible with the Docker environment.

For all of these cases, each new build stage starts from the results of the previous build stage. If you run `build.sh --remote`, it will attempt to fetch a pre-built image for the previous build stage from the official Astrobee Docker repository. Without `--remote`, it will assume you built the previous stage yourself and search for the image on your local system.

If you've made changes to ARS, here's how to figure out what `build.sh` target to specify:

- `astrobee_quick`: This is the most common target. It rebuilds the ARS instance within your container to reflect your changes, taking advantage of cached results from the most recent build of the `astrobee` image to speed up compilation. The ARS build system is designed to detect when cached results need to be rebuilt by comparing file timestamps. However, the detection is not perfect in all cases, and invalid cache contents can occasionally cause build errors.
- `astrobee`: You can use this target when building `astrobee_quick` generates errors that might be due to invalid cache contents. Because building `astrobee` starts from the `astrobee_base` image with no previous ARS compilation results, building it effectively clears the cache. It is also used in continuous integration workflows where we want to have strict configuration management to make the output products more deterministic.
- `astrobee_base`: As an external developer, you generally shouldn't need to build this target. That's good, because building the external libraries from source typically takes hours. As a NASA-internal developer, you may rarely need to build `astrobee_base` if you are modifying `astrobee_base.Dockerfile` to install new external dependencies needed by the `develop` and `master` branches.
- `test_astrobee`: This target is mostly used in continuous integration workflows. Something to watch out for: because it always runs on top of the `astrobee` image, the test results will not reflect any changes that you compiled only by building `astrobee_quick`. You can manually run the same tests in the `astrobee_quick` container like this:
    ```bash
    host$ ./scripts/docker/run.sh -i "quick-" -- bash
    docker# /src/astrobee/src/scripts/run_tests.sh
    ```

In order to execute each of these build stages, `build.sh` invokes `docker build` on the corresponding `Dockerfile` in the `scripts/docker` folder, such as `astrobee_base.Dockerfile`. These files can give you insight into the detailed build steps at each stage.

## Other build targets

The `build.sh` script provides two other targets that are not build stages, but rather actions that you can take with the resulting products:

- `push_astrobee_base` - Pushes the locally built `astrobee_base` image to our official Docker image repository
- `push_astrobee` - Pushes the locally built `astrobee` image to our official Docker image repository

These targets are mostly used in continuous integration workflows.

All pre-built remote images are available on [GitHub here](https://github.com/nasa/astrobee/pkgs/container/astrobee).

## Other build options

By default, the build script will automatically detect your host's Ubuntu OS version and configure the Docker image to use the same version using `Dockerfile` `ARGS`.

However, there is no requirement for the host OS and the Docker image OS to match.  You can override the default and select a specific Docker image Ubuntu version by specifying `--xenial` or `--focal` for Ubuntu 16.04 or 20.04 docker images, respectively.

For more information about all the build arguments:

```bash
./scripts/docker/build.sh -h
```

The `build.sh` script normally manages these `Dockerfile` `ARGS` but you can set them yourself if you run `docker build` manually:

- `UBUNTU_VERSION` - The version of Ubuntu to use. Valid values are "16.04" and "20.04".
- `ROS_VERSION` - The version of ROS to use. Valid values are "kinetic", "melodic", and "noetic".
- `PYTHON` - The version of Python to use. Valid values are "" (an empty string representing Python 2) and "3".

Constraints:
- If `UBUNTU_VERSION` is `"16.04"`, `ROS_VERSION` and `PYTHON` must be `"kinetic"` and `""` respectively.
- If `UBUNTU_VERSION` is `"20.04"`, `ROS_VERSION` and `PYTHON` must be `"noetic"` and `"3"` respectively.

The Docker files also accept args to use local or container registry images.

- `REMOTE` - The repository where the dockerfile should derive its base. Valid values are `astrobee` (the default for local builds) or `ghcr.io/nasa` (the official repository used with `--remote`).
- `REMOTE_CACHED` - (Only for `astrobee_quick.dockerfile`, defaults to `${REMOTE}`). The repository for the build cache image. Valid values are the same as for `REMOTE`.

# Running Docker containers

## Run the Astrobee simulator in the container

To run the Astrobee simulator in the container:

```bash
./scripts/docker/run.sh --remote
```

For more information about all the arguments:

```bash
./scripts/docker/run.sh -h
```

There are available options such as `--args` that allow you to add to the default sim arguments (`dds:=false robot:=sim_pub`) such as to open rviz or gazebo (`--args "rviz:=true sviz:=true"`).

To open another terminal inside the same docker container:

```bash
docker exec -it astrobee /astrobee_init.sh bash
```

(The `/astrobee_init.sh` script configures the shell in the container
to know about the Astrobee development environment, then runs the
specified command, in this case `bash`, to get an interactive shell.)

To shutdown the docker container, run:

```bash
./scripts/docker/shutdown.sh
```

## Run other commands in the container

Besides the simulator, you can also run arbitrary commands with `run.sh`. To
get an interactive shell:

```bash
./scripts/docker/run.sh --remote -- bash
```

Or run any other command:

```bash
./scripts/docker/run.sh --remote -- rosmsg info std_msgs/Header
```

(The `--` separator is usually not necessary, but makes the `run.sh`
argument parsing more predictable.)

As with `build.sh`, by default, the docker image OS version will be
configured to match your host's OS version, but you can override that
by specifying the `--xenial` or `--focal` option for
Ubuntu 16.04 or 20.04 docker images, respectively.

Use `--remote` to fetch and run a pre-built Astrobee docker
image. (Omit `--remote` to run using a docker image built locally by
`./build.sh`.)

Use `--no-display` to skip setting up the X graphical environment. The
script will also automatically skip X setup if it detects you are in a
headless host environment. Of course, graphical applications will not
be available.

Use `--mount` to mount your local source checkout into its standard
location in the docker container, where it will override the copy
embedded within the container. This is ideal for making changes in
your host environment, then quickly testing them in the container.

## Run unit tests in the container

The `run_tests.sh` script (located in the parent `scripts` folder) is
designed to run within the container and closely mimic the testing
actions in `test_astrobee.Dockerfile`, which is invoked by the
`astrobee` GitHub continuous integration workflow. You can use it to
replicate and debug failed CI tests.

Example usage:

```bash
host$ ./scripts/docker/run.sh --remote --mount
docker# (cd /src/astrobee && catkin build [package])  # recompile local changes
docker# /src/astrobee/src/scripts/run_tests.sh [package]
```

The package argument is optional. The default is to build/test all
packages.

If debugging a CI failure that is specific to a particular OS version,
remember to pass `run.sh` the `--xenial` or `--focal`
option to select the right OS version to replicate the failure.

Note: integration tests that use Gazebo simulation will be silently
disabled when running with `--no-display`. To ensure complete testing,
run in a host environment that supports X graphics.

If you care about higher-fidelity replication of CI problems and are
willing to wait through a full `astrobee` build, you can also use
`build.sh` to invoke `test_astrobee.Dockerfile` itself, like this:

```bash
./scripts/docker/build.sh --remote astrobee test_astrobee
```

Or, if you made changes that affect `astrobee_base.Dockerfile`, you
will need to rebuild that locally as well:

```bash
./scripts/docker/build.sh astrobee_base astrobee test_astrobee
```

# Advanced build options (NASA users only)

## Cross-compile Astrobee (NASA users only)

To cross-compile Astrobee, you will need
to install a cross-compile chroot and toolchain. Select two directories for
these:

```bash
export ARMHF_CHROOT_DIR=$HOME/arm_cross/rootfs
export ARMHF_TOOLCHAIN=$HOME/arm_cross/toolchain/gcc
```

Append these lines to your `.bashrc` file, as you will need these two variables
every time you cross compile.

Next, download the cross toolchain and install the chroot:

```bash
mkdir -p $ARMHF_TOOLCHAIN
cd $HOME/arm_cross
$SOURCE_PATH/submodules/platform/fetch_toolchain.sh
$SOURCE_PATH/submodules/platform/rootfs/make_chroot.sh xenial dev $ARMHF_CHROOT_DIR
```

From the root of the repository, run:

```bash
./scripts/docker/cross_compile/cross_compile.sh
```

The code will be cross-compiles inside the docker container in /opt/astrobee, and
can be copied to the robot.

After the debian files are generated inside the docker image, they are copied to
in order of priority:
1) To the `INSTALL_PATH`, if defined.
2) To `${DIR}/../../../../astrobee_install/armhf/`, if the directory already exists,
where `$DIR` is the directory where the cross_compile.sh script is located.
3) To `$HOME/astrobee_build/armhf` otherwise.

If you already cross-compiled once and just wish to rebuild the code, run:

```bash
./scripts/docker/cross_compile/rebuild_cross_compile.sh
```

## Building an Astrobee Debian (NASA users only)

This step assumes that the cross compile setup was successful and that `ARMHF_CHROOT_DIR`
and `ARMHF_TOOLCHAIN` are defined. If not, please follow the cross-compile instructions.

To generate the debians, from the root of the repository, run:

```bash
./scripts/docker/cross_compile/debian_compile.sh
```

After the debian files are generated inside the docker image, they are copied to the
folder before the root of the repository, `${DIR}/../../../../`, where `$DIR` is the directory where the `debian_compile.sh` script is located.
